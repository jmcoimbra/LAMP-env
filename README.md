# LAMP-env

Main documentation is here: http://jmcoimbra.github.io/LAMP-env/

This repo intention is to provide an environment to develop websites using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP).

I accept help to update our LAMP best practices and also to get it "dockerized" and "vagranted-up".

Let's have a good development.

Cheers!
